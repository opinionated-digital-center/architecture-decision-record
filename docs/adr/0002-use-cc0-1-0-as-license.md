# Use CC0-1.0 as license

Adapted from
[MADR's similar decision record](https://github.com/adr/madr/blob/2.1.2/docs/adr/0001-use-CC0-as-license.md).

* Status: Approved
* Date: 2020-03-31

## Context and Problem Statement

Everything needs to be licensed, otherwise the default copyright laws apply.
For instance, in Germany that means users may not alter anything without explicitly asking for permission.
For more information see <https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/>.

We want to have Opinionated Digital Center's ADR used freely and without hassle, and
we would like also to be credited for the original creation.

## Considered Options

* [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)
* [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)
* [CC-BY-3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)
* No license
* Other open source licenses

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "CC0", because although "CC-BY-X.0" licenses require users to credit
authors for the original work, they also require them to indicate if - or even what -
changes have been made, which we feel could restrain reuse and adoption.
See [examples of marking requirements](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution#This_is_a_good_attribution_for_material_you_modified_slightly),
which we feel will create too much hassle.
