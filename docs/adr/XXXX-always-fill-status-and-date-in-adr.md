* Status: proposed
* Date: 2020-04-02

## Context and Problem Statement

Status and date are necessary to follow the lifecycle and history of the ADRs. They are
optional in the orginal MADR template, the usage of which was decided in
[ADR-0001](0001-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md).

## Considered Options

* Change status and date to non-optional in the MADR template
* Leave status and date as optional

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Change status and date to non-optional in the MADR template", because
it will ensure users know they have to fill it in.
